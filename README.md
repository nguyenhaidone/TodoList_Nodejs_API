# todolist_nodejs_api

# Getting started
1. ```npm i```  to install dependencies. This might take a while.
2. ```npm run dev``` to run development build.

# Notice
You can read all of apis in request.http file. If you wanna test all of apis in request.http, you must install REST Client extension in vscode. After that, you can send request and receive response in request.http file without Postman.
